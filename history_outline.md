# Fort Needham 

Fort Needham is a drumlin hill on the Halifax Peninsula, over 2 kilometres northwest of the city's downtown core, and with its peak about 70 metres above sea level. As an urban site, it is unique by its ever-changing purpose throughout the city's history, being variously: 

* farmland 
* two different forts
* military barracks
* marshalling grounds
* parkland
* sportsfields
* a public monument
* land for temporary housing. 

It is significant to Halifax's military history as well as an important site for the memorializing of the 1917 Halifax Explosion. 

## first nations settlement

People have occupied Nova Scotia for the last 11,000 years -- to the period known as the **Sa'qewe'k L'nu'k** or paleo-Indian period. There is no evidence of pre-European contact First Nations settlement anywhere on the Halifax peninsula including Fort Needham, though marshy areas (such as the land where the Halifax Commons is today) were traditionally used for moose hunting by the Mi'kmaq. 

Halifax Peninsula was part of the district called Eskikewa’kik or the "skin dressers territory".

## Fort Needham and the founding of Halifax

Halifax was founded in 1749 -- and what is now known as Fort Needham was well outside the palisade of the town as it was initially surveyed, over 2.2km from the city walls. 

In 1753 the 32 hectares of Needham hill was granted to the Governor of Nova Scotia, and it was called the *Governor's North Farm*. The land was cleared and farmed, subdivided several times, and buildings were built on the south western corner, where Young and Gottingen Streets meet and where a large apartment building stands today. The hill would have been a long walk for a Halifax resident of the 1750s; the original survey of the Town Halifax was a square approximately 700m by 390m, meaning the hill was over 3 times the town's length away. 

By the 1770s the town had grown long beyond the early palisades. Both the Royal Dockyard and extensive suburbs grew north of the town, up along the harbour. Concern about the American Revolutionary War caused the government to consider upgrading its defences. 

In 1776, a redoubt was built on the south side of the hill, which, as one of the highest points on the peninsula, had a great view of the harbour and overland to the west and south. Two barracks - with room for 50-100 men each - were built inside a ditch within a raised berm. Plans called for a blockhouse on the north end of the hill, which was never built. Owner James Pedley had his land expropriated for the purpose. Originally called *Pedley's Hill Redoubt*, Fort Needham was the new name given in 1778, Needham being a friend of William Spry, the Royal Engineer who was responsible for the fort-building. 

Counter-intuitively, the fort was intended primarily the protect the Royal Dockyards from overland attacks, and as such, it faced the road into Halifax from the north, not the harbour. Two 24lb. cannons pointed west on the road into Halifax, and 2 cannons pointed south to protect Fort George (the Citadel). 

By the beginning of the 19th century, the fort was already in ruin. It was meant to be temporary, and was no longer necessary after the revolutionary war was over. War broke out again in 1803, this time between Britain and France during the Napoleonic Wars. After the Leopard-Chesapeake Affair of 1807, wherein the British ship *Leopard* boarded the American *Chesapeake* to search for British deserters in the high Atlantic seas, a rumour was circulated that the Americans would retaliate by attacking Halifax. As a result, a new fort was planned to be built on Fort Needham hill that same year. 

The second fort was conceived as a large facility, about the same size at Fort George / the Halifax Citadel, including a stone tower with a removable roof, and a barracks for 300 men. However, what was actually built ended up being pretty similar to the original Fort Needham, a redoubt with a building inside (either a barracks or a berm). This time, a wooden blockhouse was built at the north part of the hill to protect the redoubt from invaders coming up the north side of the hill. 

By 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812 had ended, the wooden buildings of Fort Needham were let to rot again. There was some discussion of making a new stone tower on the site as part of a four tower defence system for the city. Unfortunately, Fort George (the Citadel) took 30 years to build, cost double its budget, and was obsolete by the time it was finished, leaving no resources left to finish Fort Needham. In the 1850s, the redoubt was still visible, but there wasn't much left. At that point, the hill no longer served any military purpose. 

## settlement at the hill

The industrialization of the area began in the 1860s. Down the hill to the east, the sprawling Richmond railway yards of the Intercolonial Railway dominated the waterfront. The rail yards contained the city's only railway station - pretty far from the city's centre. 

South of the hill, the military opened the Needham barracks, or what came to be known as the Wellington barracks. Soldiers used nearby Needham hill for playing polo, and as a rifle range. Farmers still used the hill as pasture land. Even though residents filled the area around Needham, the hill remained a pastoral area. 

The district around Fort Needham became known as Richmond, after Richmond Virginia, from which came the sugar for the massive Acadia Sugar Refinery based in the area. Other factories, such as Imperial Oil and Richmond Printing were based in the area because of proximity to the rail yards. Workers and factory owners alike moved into the area to be close to where they made their living. 

Part of Needham hill remained open space into the 20th century, used by the military for training grounds, and by the residents for recreation. 

## 1917 Halifax explosion

On Dec 6, 1917, the Mont-Blanc, a French tramp steamer laden with 3000 tonnes of American explosives bound for Bordeaux France, blew up in the harbour near the foot of Richmond Street. 2000 people died, and unknown thousands were injured. Whole city blocks in Richmond were completely razed, especially those to the east of Fort Needham. The hill itself deflected some of the blast upwards, though houses and institutions on the west side of the hill were not altogether spared. 

Fort Needham hill was covered in iron and steel pieces of the Mont-Blanc, as well as dead bodies and housing debris. After the calamity, the hill was used as a camp for the newly homeless, as were the citadel and Halifax Commons. 

The Government of Canada founded the Halifax Relief Commission early in 1918 to resurrect Richmond. It was given nearly complete expropriation powers over 121.5 hectares of devastated land, and was mandated to plan and build new housing. The Hydrostone area, to the west of Fort Needham hill, is the best known of the new housing created by the HRC. It was conceived in the style of a "garden suburb" by renowned British planner *Thomas Adams* along with Montréal-based architects *Ross and Macdonald*. Several new streets (e.g. Dartmouth, Devonshire and Union) were created north of Fort Needham, as well as new housing east of the hill. 

1922 aerial photographs show a completely bare hill, with some relic of the 1807 fort's earthworks. The hill was subject to heavy erosion - and crews from Rockhead Prison (a large facility to the north of Fort Needham) were often called in to remove soil that washed down onto Gottingen Street and the trolley tracks in the early 20th century. 

Oddly, Fort Needham had never been turned over to Canada by the British government in 1906 when the British Royal Navy left Halifax. With some difficulty, the land was eventually turned over to the Halifax Relief Commission (HRC). In the 1940s the HRC's "Needham Park" was planted with poplar trees, levelled for sportsfields, and a playground and canteen were built. Much of Needham Park as it exists today is as a result of the landscaping done in the 40s and 50s. 

The park was ceded to the city in 1959. 

In 1983-4 a citizens' group raised $400,000 for a memorial carillon that now sits at the northern edge of the hilltop. The concrete, triangle-shaped monument has a gap which points to ground zero of the 1917 explosion at the harbour, at the bottom of the hill. The tower's bells donated to the Kaye Street United Memorial Church in memory the Orr Family who died in the Explosion. 

Every December 6, a commemoration is held at the Memorial Bell Tower for the disaster. A moment of silence is followed by the ringing of the bells.
