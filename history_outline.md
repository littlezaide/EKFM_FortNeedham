# Fort Needham 

Fort Needham is a drumlin hill on the Halifax Peninsula, over 2 kilometres northwest of the city's downtown core, and with its peak about 70 metres above sea level. As an open-space urban site, it is unique having an ever-changing purpose throughout the city's history, being variously: 

* farmland 
* two different forts
* military barracks
* marshalling grounds
* parkland
* sportsfields
* a public monument
* land for temporary housing. 

The hill is significant to Halifax's defensive military history and is an important memorial site for the 1917 Halifax Explosion. 

## first nations settlement

People have occupied Nova Scotia for the last 11,000 years -- to the period known as the **Sa'qewe'k L'nu'k** or paleo-Indian period. There is no evidence of pre-European contact First Nations settlement anywhere on the Halifax peninsula, including on Fort Needham hill, though marshy areas (such as the land where the Halifax Commons is today) were traditionally used for moose hunting by the Mi'kmaq. Halifax Peninsula was part of the district called Eskikewa’kik or the "skin dressers territory".

## Fort Needham and the founding of Halifax

Halifax was founded in 1749, and the hill now known as Fort Needham lay well outside the palisades of the young town, over 2.2km from the city walls. 

In 1753 the 32 hectares of the hill were granted to the Governor of Nova Scotia, and it was given the name *Governor's North Farm*. The land was cleared and farmed, subdivided several times, and buildings were built on the south western corner, where Young and Gottingen Streets meet and where a large apartment building stands today. The hill would have been a long walk for a Halifax resident of the 1750s. The original survey of the town of Halifax was a rectangle of land approximately 700m by 390m; the hill would have been over 3 times the town's length away. 

By the 1770s the town had grown well beyond the early palisades. Both the Royal Dockyard and the extensive suburbs grew north of the town, up along the harbour. Concern about the American Revolutionary War caused the government to consider upgrading its defences, and the British Royal Engineers built a fort on the south side of the hill for this purpose in 1776. 

As one of the highest points on the peninsula, the hill had a great view of the harbour as well as over-land to the west and south. Two barracks were built inside a ditch within a raised berm, each barrack having room for 50-100 men. Plans called for a blockhouse on the north end of the hill, which was never built. The fort was originally known as *Pedley's Hill Redoubt*, after landowner James Pedley, whose  land was expropriated for the purpose. In 1778 the name was officially changed to Fort Needham, Needham being a friend of William Spry, the Royal Engineer who was responsible for the fort plans and construction. Fort Needham persists as the name of the site until today, long after the fort itself disappeared. 

Counter-intuitively, Fort Needham was intended primarily the protect the Royal Naval Yard from overland attacks, and as such, it faced the road into Halifax from the north, not the harbour. Two 24lb. cannons pointed west toward the road, and 2 cannons pointed south toward Fort George (the Citadel). 

By the beginning of the 19th century, the fort was already in ruin. It was meant to be a temporary structure, and was no longer necessary after the revolutionary war was over. Unfortunately, war broke out again in 1803, this time between Britain and France during the Napoleonic Wars. After the Leopard-Chesapeake Affair of 1807, wherein the British ship *Leopard* boarded the American *Chesapeake* to search for British deserters in the high Atlantic seas, a rumour was circulated that the Americans would retaliate by attacking Halifax. As a result, the Royal Engineers planned another fort to be built on the hill.

The second fort was conceived as a large facility, about the same size at Fort George / the Halifax Citadel, including a stone tower with a removable roof, and a barracks for 300 men. However, what was actually built ended up being pretty similar to the original Fort Needham, a redoubt with a building inside (either a barracks or a berm). This time, a wooden blockhouse was built at the northern edge of the hill to protect the redoubt from invaders coming up the north side. 

By 1815, after the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812 had ended, the wooden buildings of Fort Needham were let to rot again. There was some discussion of making a new stone tower on the site as part of a four tower defence system for the city. Unfortunately, Fort George (the Citadel) took 30 years to build (it was supposed to be done in 6), cost double its budget, and was obsolete by the time it was finished, leaving no resources left to finish Fort Needham. In the 1850s, the redoubt was still visible, but there wasn't much left. At that point, Fort Needham no longer served any military purpose. 

## settlement around the hill

The industrialization of the area began in the 1860s. Down the hill to the east, the sprawling Richmond railway yards of the Intercolonial Railway dominated the waterfront. The rail yards contained the city's first and only railway station - pretty far from the city's centre. 

South of the hill, the military opened the Needham barracks, or what came to be known as the Wellington barracks. Soldiers used nearby Needham hill for playing polo, and as a rifle range. Farmers still used the hill as pasture land. Even though residents filled the area around Needham, the hill itself remained a pastoral, open-space area. 

The district around Fort Needham became known as Richmond, after Richmond Virginia, from which came the sugar for the massive Acadia Sugar Refinery based in the area. Other factories, such as Imperial Oil and Richmond Printing were based in the area because of proximity to the rail yards. Workers and factory owners alike moved into the area to be close to where they made their living. 

Part of Needham hill remained open-space into the 20th century, used by the military for training grounds, and by the residents for recreation. 

## 1917 Halifax explosion

In the middle of the First World War, on Dec 6, 1917, a French tramp steamer named the Mont-Blanc blew up in the harbour near the foot of Richmond Street. It was laden with 3000 tonnes of American explosives bound for Bordeaux France, where they would be melted into shells to be used by the Allies. 2000 people died, and unknown thousands were injured - massive casualties suffered by civilians in a time of war, and by far the largest loss of life on Canadian home soil. Whole city blocks in Richmond were completely razed, especially those to the east of Fort Needham. The hill itself deflected some of the blast upwards, though houses and institutions on the west side of the hill were not altogether spared. 

Fort Needham hill was covered in iron and steel pieces of the Mont-Blanc, as well as dead bodies and housing debris. After the calamity, Fort Needham hill was used as a camp for residents made homeless by the blast.

The Government of Canada founded the Halifax Relief Commission early in 1918 to resurrect Richmond. It was given nearly complete expropriation powers over 121.5 hectares of devastated land, and was mandated to plan and build new housing. The Hydrostone area, to the west of Fort Needham hill, is today the best known of the new housing created by the HRC. It was conceived in the style of a "garden suburb" by renowned British planner *Thomas Adams* along with Montréal-based architects *Ross and Macdonald*. Several new streets (e.g. Dartmouth, Devonshire and Union) were created north of Fort Needham, as well as new housing east of the hill. 

Adams planned Fort Needham park as the central neighbourhood park for the area, though it was not developed as a park until much later. 1922 aerial photographs show a completely bare hill, with some relic of the 1807 fort's earthworks. The hill was covered only by scrub plants and soil and was subject to heavy erosion; crews from Rockhead Prison (a large facility to the north of Fort Needham) were often called in to remove soil that washed down onto Gottingen Street and its trolley tracks in the early 20th century. 

Oddly, Fort Needham had never been turned over to Canada by the British government in 1906 when the British Royal Navy left Halifax. With some difficulty, the land was eventually turned over to the Halifax Relief Commission (HRC). In the 1940s the HRC's "Needham Park" was planted with poplar trees, levelled for sportsfields, and a playground and canteen were built. Much of Needham Park as it looks today is as a result of the extensive landscaping done by the Halifax Relief Commission in the 40s and 50s. It is likely that any vestiges of the fort earthworks from the 19th century were erased by the landscaping in the 1950s. The park was ceded to the city in 1959. 

In 1983-4 a citizens' group raised $400,000 for a memorial carillon that now sits at the northern edge of the hilltop. Designed by renowned Halifax architect Keigh L. Graham, the concrete, triangle-shaped monument has a gap which points the viewer to ground zero of the 1917 explosion at the harbour, at the bottom of the hill. The tower's bells come from the Kaye Street United Memorial Church, in memory of the Orr Family who died in the Explosion. 

Every December 6, a commemoration of the 1917 explosion is held on Fort Needham by the Memorial Bell Tower. A moment of silence is followed by the ringing of the bells.
