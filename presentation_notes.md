# Early Halifax 

- Halifax founded 1749, the hill that is now Fort Needham was over 2km from the city palisades. The hill was farmland. 
- two different forts were built on the hill to protect the Halifax Dockyards, one for the Revolutionary war in 1776 and one in 1808 for the Napoleonic Wars. They were both temporary and both were quickly let to rot when war was over.
